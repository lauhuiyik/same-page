Introduction <a name='intro'></a>
--------------------------------
Remember how the project that time went? It went pretty bad right? People were goofing off, slacking and leaving all the work to one person.

We are here to change **that!** Regardless of what project it is, whether it is a school assignment or a programming project, we provide a platform where you can work on the same file **at the same time**. We think that by having everyone working on something at the same time, the group's progress and productivity will vastly improve.

Features <a name='intro'></a>
--------------------------------
- Real-time file editting
- Have group chats
- Upload files on site
